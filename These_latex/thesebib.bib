	abstract = {Digital image correlation ({DIC}) for displacement and strain measurement has flourished in recent years. There are integer pixel and subpixel matching steps to extract displacement from a series of images in the {DIC} approach, and identification accuracy mainly depends on the latter step. A subpixel displacement matching method, named the double-precision gradient-based algorithm ({DPG}), is proposed in this study. After, the integer pixel displacement is identified using the coarse-fine search algorithm. In order to improve the accuracy and anti-noise capability in the subpixel extraction step, the traditional gradient-based method is used to analyze the data on the speckle patterns using the computer, and the influence of noise is considered. These two nearest integer pixels in one direction are both utilized as an interpolation center. Then, two subpixel displacements are extracted by the five-point bicubic spline interpolation algorithm using these two interpolation centers. A novel combination coefficient considering contaminated noises is presented to merge these two subpixel displacements to obtain the final identification displacement. Results from a simulated speckle pattern and a painted beam bending test show that the accuracy of the proposed method can be improved by four times that of the traditional gradient-based method that reaches the same high accuracy as the Newton–Raphson method. The accuracy of the proposed method efficiently reaches at 92.67\%, higher than the Newton-Raphon method, and it has better anti-noise performance and stability.},

              Fault stability is inherently linked to the frictional and healing properties of fault rocks and associated fabrics. Their complex interaction controls how the stored elastic energy is dissipated, that is, through creep or seismic motion. In this work, we focus on the relevance of fault fabrics in controlling the reactivation and slip behavior of dolomite‐anhydrite analog faults. We designed a set of laboratory experiments where we first develop fault rocks characterized by different grain size reduction and localization at normal stresses of
              σ
              
                N
              
               = 15, 35, 60, and 100 {MPa} and second, we reload and reactivate these fault rocks at the frictional stability transition, achieved at
              σ
              
                N
              
              = 35 {MPa} by reducing the machine stiffness. If normal stress is lowered this way, reactivation occurs with relatively large stress drops and large peak‐slip velocities. Subsequent unstable behavior produces slow stick‐slip events with low stress drop and with either asymmetric or Gaussian slip velocity function depending on the inherited fault fabric. If normal stress is raised, deformation is accommodated within angular cataclasites promoting stable slip. The integration of microstructural data (showing brittle reworking of preexisting textures) with mechanical data (documenting restrengthening and dilation upon reactivation) suggests that frictional and chemically assisted healing, which is common in natural faults during the interseismic phase, can be a relevant process in developing large instabilities. We also conclude that fault rock heterogeneity (fault fabric) modulates the slip velocity function and thus the dynamics of repeating stick‐slip cycles.

            Plain Language Summary
            Displacement is accommodated within the Earth's upper crust through motion along fault zones. These fault zones are composed of a wide variety of deformed rocks, which are characterized by different geometric (e.g., inner textures) and physico‐chemical properties. Such complexity is key in controlling how the elastic energy stored in the loading medium surrounding the fault will be dissipated in time, for example, through slow (aseismic creep) or fast slip (earthquakes). This study presents a series of laboratory experiments where: (a) a range of pressures are applied to form fault rocks characterized by different inner textures; and then (b) the fault rocks are reactivated at the same experimental conditions, chosen to favor unstable sliding as documented in previous experiments in the same material. The observed slip behavior of reactivated faults indicates that the fault's inner textures greatly influence how our experimental faults move. For instance, fault motion is observed to occur constantly in presence of heterogeneous slip zones, and rhythmically (a behavior known as stick‐slip) in homogenous, fine‐grained slip zones. Chemically assisted processes, favored by high pressures and the presence of fluids, promote rehealing of the fault, favoring reactivation with energetic slip events that can be as fast as earthquakes.

            We model laboratory earthquakes in a biaxial shear apparatus using the Shear‐Transformation‐Zone ({STZ}) theory of dense granular flow. The theory is based on the observation that slip events in a granular layer are attributed to grain rearrangement at soft spots called {STZs}, which can be characterized according to principles of statistical physics. We model lab data on granular shear using {STZ} theory and document direct connections between the {STZ} approach and rate‐and‐state friction. We discuss the stability transition from stable shear to stick‐slip failure and show that stick slip is predicted by {STZ} when the applied shear load exceeds a threshold value that is modulated by elastic stiffness and frictional rheology. We also show that {STZ} theory mimics fault zone dilation during the stick phase, consistent with lab observations.

A growing body of observations document this spectrum of failure modes in many geologic settings. However, the physical mechanisms that dictate slow slip are not understood. Here we investigate the mechanics of slow slip using carefully controlled laboratory experiments that demonstrate a complete spectrum of slip modes: Laboratory stick-slip event durations span from seconds to milliseconds, representing the equivalent of failure events that span the range from slow to dynamic earthquakes. The rheological critical stiffness kc is the primary control on the mode of slip, but higher-order effects including velocity dependence of the frictional rate parameter and critical slip distance also play an important role. We also find that quasi-dynamic instability results from negligible stress drop near the stability boundary, in tandem with negative feedback during slip acceleration rooted in the rate dependence of kc. Our work shows that a broad spectrum of slip behaviors can arise from a common frictional mechanism modulated by fault zone rheology and elastic properties.},

Slip at sub-seismogenic speeds is evident from top to bottom of lithospheric faults and plays an important role throughout the earthquake cycle. Where earthquakes and tremor accompany slow slip, they help illuminate the spatiotemporal evolution of fault slip. Geophysical subsurface imaging and geologic field studies provide information about suitable environments of slow slip. In particular, exhumed fault and shear zones from various depths reveal the importance of multiple deformation processes and fault-zone structures. Most geologic examples feature frictionally weak and velocity-strengthening materials, well-developed mineral fabrics, and abundant veining indicative of near-lithostatic fluid pressure. To produce transient slow slip events and tremor, in addition to the presence of high-pressure fluids a heterogeneous fault-zone structure, composition, and/or metamorphic assemblage may be needed. Laboratory and computational models suggest that velocity-weakening slip patches smaller than a critical dimension needed for earthquake nucleation will also fail in slow slip events. Changes in fluid pressure or slip rate can cause a fault to transition between stable and unstable fault slip behavior. Future interdisciplinary investigations of slow fault slip, directly integrating geophysical, geological and modeling investigations, will further improve our understanding of the dynamics of slow slip and aid in providing more accurate earthquake hazard characterizations.},

            Geological heterogeneity is abundant in crustal fault zones; however, its role in controlling the mechanical behaviour of faults is poorly constrained. Here, we present laboratory friction experiments on laterally heterogeneous faults, with patches of strong, rate-weakening quartz gouge and weak, rate-strengthening clay gouge. The experiments show that the heterogeneity leads to a significant reduction in strength and frictional stability in comparison to compositionally identical faults with homogeneously mixed gouges. We identify a combination of weakening effects, including smearing of the weak clay; differential compaction of the two gouges redistributing normal stress; and shear localization producing stress concentrations in the strong quartz patches. The results demonstrate that geological heterogeneity and its evolution can have pronounced effects on fault strength and stability and, by extension, on the occurrence of slow-slip transients versus earthquake ruptures and the characteristics of the resulting events, and should be further studied in lab experiments and earthquake source modelling.},

	abstract = {We analyze the dilation of the system in a cylindrical granular fault consisting of a monolayer of disks submitted to both normal pressure and continuous and slow shear, which results in intermittent and sudden energy release events that reproduce the main laws of seismicity. The dilation of the system can be separated into two parts: a smooth increase of dilation, plus sudden changes both contracting and dilating the medium, which are correlated to abrupt jumps -both positive and negative- in the measured resisting torque. We explain the four possible (and existing) general scenarios combining those two variables: dilation and torque, thanks to the assumption of an optimal local angle in the direction of force chains, and each reorganization of the structure as a replacement of the force chain holding most of the applied stress. The average rate of increase of global dilation varies monotonically with the size of the energy release event, making dilation a plausible candidate to predict catastrophic events in such earthquake-like systems.},

In the frame of {VAMAS} an international round robin comparison on the reproducibility and comparability of friction and wear data has been performed under conditions of dry sliding. The tribological behaviour of a[-A1203 ceramic and {AISI} 52100 steel combinations in a defined ball-on-disc configuration was determined under specified operating conditions of load, speed, temperature and sliding distance. For the different material combinations typical wear patterns were observed, including substantial material transfer for the steel-steel and steel-ceramic systems, but very minor wear was observed for the ceramic couple. Comparison of the numeric friction and wear data shows good agreement in tribological terms. The test methodology and the numeric tribological data may serve as a reference for other comparable tribotests.},

	abstract = {When a crack interacts with material heterogeneities, its front distorts and adopts complex tortuous conﬁgurations that are reminiscent of the energy barriers encountered during crack propagation. As such, the study of crack front deformations is key to rationalize the eﬀective failure properties of micro-structured solids and interfaces. Yet, the impact of a localized dissipation in a ﬁnite region behind the crack front, called the process zone, has often been overlooked. In this work, we derive the equation ruling 3D coplanar crack propagation in heterogeneous cohesive materials where the opening of the crack is resisted by some traction in its wake. We show that the presence of a process zone results in two competing eﬀects on the deformation of crack fronts: (i) it makes the front more compliant to small-wavelength perturbations, and (ii) it smooths out local ﬂuctuations of strength and process zone size, from which emerge heterogeneities of fracture energy. Their respective inﬂuence on front deformations is shown to strongly impact the stability of perturbed crack fronts, as well as their stationary shapes when interacting with arrays of tough obstacles. Overall, our theory provides a uniﬁed framework to predict the variety of front proﬁles observed in experiments, even when the small-scale yielding hypothesis of linear elastic fracture mechanics breaks down.},

            Memory effects in seismology—such as the occurrence of aftershock sequences—are implicitly assumed to be governed by the time since the main event. However, experiments are yet to identify if memory effects are structural or time-dependent mechanisms. Here, we use laser interferometry to examine the fluctuations of deformation which naturally emerge along an experimental shear fault within a compressed frictional granular medium. We find that deformation occurs as a succession of localized micro-slips distributed along the fault. The associated distributions of released seismic moments, as well as the memory effects in strain fluctuations and the time correlations between successive events, follow exactly the empirical laws of natural earthquakes. We use a methodology initially developed in seismology to reveal at the laboratory scale the underlying causal structure of this behavior and identify the triggering kernel. We propose that strain, not time, controls the memory effects in our fault analog.},

	abstract = {Direct shear experiments on ground surfaces of a granodiorite from Raymond, California, at normal stresses of ∼6 {MPa} demonstrate that competing time, displacement, and velocity effects control rock friction. It is proposed that the strength of the population of points of contacts between sliding surfaces determines frictional strength and that the population of contacts changes continuously with displacements. Previous experiments demonstrate that the strength of the contacts increases with the age of the contacts. The present experiments establish that a characteristic displacement, proportional to surface roughness, is required to change the population of contacts. Hence during slip the average age of the points of contact and therefore frictional strength decrease as slip velocity increases. Displacement weakening and consequently the potential for unstable slip occur whenever displacement reduces the average age of the contacts. In addition to this velocity dependency, which arises from displacement dependency and time dependency, the experiments also show a competing but transient increase in friction whenever slip velocity increases. Creep of the sliding surface at stresses below that for steady state slip is also observed. Constitutive relationships are developed that permit quantitative simulation of the friction versus displacement data as a function of surface roughness and for different time and velocity histories. Unstable slip in experiments is controlled by these constitutive effects and by the stiffness of the experimental system. It is argued that analogous properties control earthquake instability.},

	abstract = {Occurrence of instability in crustal faults depends in part on the small‐magnitude dependence of frictional strength on slip rate and slip history. Rate dependence of friction reflects the operation of thermally activated mechanisms at points of contact along fault surfaces and is expected to change in space and time owing to variations in environmental conditions and slip rates during the seismic cycle. Several lines of evidence suggest solution‐precipitation processes in fault zones may be activated during interseismic periods when slip rates are small and may contribute to fault healing. We develop a constitutive model for faulting at hypocentral conditions that is capable of describing the variation in frictional properties as different slip mechanisms are activated in response to changes in temperature or slip rate. This model is based on the assumption that slip mechanisms are thermally activated and follow an Arrhenius relationship between temperature and slip rate, which allows the addition of temperature dependence to existing rate‐ and state‐dependent friction constitutive laws. Multiple slip mechanisms are treated as operating independently and concurrently, where each mechanism is described by the rate‐, state‐, and temperature‐dependent friction constitutive relation. The constitutive model is used to analyze triaxial friction experiments on ultrafine‐grained quartz gouge at temperatures to 600°C, effective confining pressure of 150 {MPa}, and water‐saturated or room‐dry conditions. These experiments investigated the stress relaxation response and slip history effects during slide‐hold‐slide tests with hold times up to 10
              5
              s. The microstructure of the deformed quartz gouge and the transient friction behavior define at least two distinct frictional slip regimes: a low‐temperature regime characterized by cataclastic mechanisms with significant slip history effects, and a high‐temperature regime characterized by solution‐precipitation‐aided cataclastic flow with large‐magnitude rate dependence and insignificant slip history effects. In the model the parameters of the friction constitutive relation (e.g.,
              a
              ,
              b
              , and
              L
              ) are treated as constants for each slip mechanism but are different for the different mechanisms. This model accurately describes the frictional behavior within each regime and across the transition between regimes. The analysis suggests that the greatest‐magnitude rate weakening behavior occurs at 100° to 300°C under wet conditions at laboratory slip rates. Significant solution‐precipitation is activated at temperatures above 300°C at laboratory slip rates or at lower slip‐rates and lower temperatures. The high‐temperature solution‐precipitation regime is described by a large‐magnitude rate strengthening (
              a
              −
              b
              = 0.03) and an apparent activation energy of approximately 44 {kJ} mol
              −1
              . The constitutive analysis suggests that the solution‐precipitation‐aided flow mechanism could be important during interseismic periods at hypocentral conditions and low shear stress but apparently is not characterized by significant slip history effects.},

	abstract = {We observed slow frictional slip occurring at a constant shear stress below the nominal friction level and compared it with the time‐dependent strengthening of the frictional interface, which was also tracked experimentally. It was found that slip velocity decreases as the interface strengthens due to aging, while it increases with the applied shear stress. These dependencies were both exponential and were of similar magnitudes, as implied by the framework law of rate‐ and state‐dependent friction. In the spirit of the adhesion theory of friction the dependence of slip velocity on interface strength is understood to be the result of the change of the shear stress acting on frictional junctions due to the change of junction population, though the observed dependence was somewhat stronger than a simple model based on this idea predicts. By correcting the observed slip velocity for the effect of the change of the interface strength, we could obtain a unique relationship between stress and slip velocity, which may be readily compared with a standard rheological formulation. Thus the obtained relationship between stress and slip velocity showed a reasonable agreement with the absolute rate theory over a temperature range of 25–800°C for the present experimental condition (fine albite powder, 20 {MPa} normal stress, no pore water).},

We find that the velocity dependence, measured by

              changes from negative (velocity weakening) at {\textless}10 µm/s to positive (velocity strengthening) at {\textgreater}32 µm/s. Modeling of experimental data using a simple constitutive law shows that the magnitude of

	abstract = {The quantity known as the friction coefficient (or ‘coefficient of friction’) has long been used in science and engineering. It is easy to define, but not easy to understand on a fundamental level. Conceptually defined as the ratio of two forces acting, respectively, perpendicular and parallel to an interface between two bodies under relative motion or impending relative motion, this dimensionless quantity turns out to be convenient for depicting the relative ease with which materials slide over one another under particular circumstances. Despite the fact that both static and kinetic friction coefficients can be measured with little difficulty under laboratory conditions, the time- and condition-dependent characteristics of friction coefficients associated with both clean and lubricated surfaces have proven exceedingly difficult to predict a priori from first principles. The shaky nature of friction's fundamental underpinnings, has not prevented investigators from compiling lists of friction coefficients and publishing them for general use. Problems often arise, however, when engineers attempt to use tabulated friction coefficients to solve specific problems in mechanical design or failure analysis. The systems-dependence of frictional behavior is sometimes ignored, leading to misapplication of published data. This is particularly true for applications in nano-technology and others that differ from typical laboratory size scales. This paper will review the measurement and use of static and kinetic friction coefficients, discuss their usefulness, and describe the sources of frictional resistances in terms of shear localization.},

            Faults are ubiquitous throughout the Earth's crust. The majority are silent for decades to centuries, until they suddenly rupture and produce earthquakes. With a focus on shallow continental active‐tectonic regions, this paper reviews a subset of faults that have a different behavior. These unusual faults slowly creep for long periods of time and produce many small earthquakes. The presence of fault creep and the related microseismicity helps illuminate faults that might not otherwise be located in fine detail, but there is also the question of how creeping faults contribute to seismic hazard. It appears that well‐recorded creeping fault earthquakes of up to magnitude 6.6 that have occurred in shallow continental regions produce similar fault‐surface rupture areas and similar peak ground shaking as their locked fault counterparts of the same earthquake magnitude. The behavior of much larger earthquakes on shallow creeping continental faults is less well known, because there is a dearth of comprehensive observations. Computational simulations provide an opportunity to fill the gaps in our understanding, particularly of the dynamic processes that occur during large earthquake rupture and arrest.

	abstract = {Because of short recurrence times and known locations, small repeating earthquakes present a rare predictable opportunity for detailed field observations. They are used to study fault creeping velocities, earthquake nucleation, stress drops, and other aspects of tectonophysics, earthquake mechanics, and seismology. An intriguing observation about repeating earthquakes is their scaling of recurrence time with seismic moment, which is significantly different from the scaling based on a simple conceptual model of circular ruptures with stress drop independent of seismic moment and no aseismic slip. Here we show that a model of repeating earthquakes based on laboratory‐derived rate and state friction laws reproduces the observed scaling. In the model, a small fault patch governed by steady state velocity‐weakening friction is surrounded by a much larger velocity‐strengthening region. Long‐term slip behavior of the fault is simulated using a methodology that fully accounts for both aseismic slip and inertial effects of occasional seismic events. The model results in repeating earthquakes with typical stress drops and sizes comparable with observations. For a fixed set of friction parameters, the observed scaling is reproduced by varying the size of the velocity‐weakening patch. In simulations, a significant part of slip on the velocity‐weakening patches is accumulated aseismically, even though the patches also produce seismic events. The proposed model supplies a laboratory‐based framework for interpreting the wealth of observations about repeating earthquakes, provides indirect evidence that rate and state friction acts on natural faults, and has important implications for possible scenarios of slip partition into seismic and aseismic parts.},

          , 
            Strain accumulated on the deep extension of some faults is episodically released during transient slow-slip events, which can subsequently load the shallow seismogenic region. At the San Andreas fault, the characteristics of slow-slip events are difficult to constrain geodetically due to their small deformation signal. Slow-slip events ({SSEs}) are often accompanied by coincident tremor bursts composed of many low-frequency earthquakes. Here, we probabilistically estimate the spatiotemporal clustering properties of low-frequency earthquakes detected along the central San Andreas fault. We find that tremor bursts follow a power-law spatial and temporal decay similar to earthquake aftershock sequences. The low-frequency earthquake clusters reveal that the underlying slow-slip events have two modes of rupture velocity. Compared to regular earthquakes, these slow-slip events have smaller stress drop and rupture velocity but follow similar magnitude-frequency, moment-area, and moment-duration scaling. Our results connect a broad spectrum of transient fault slip that spans several orders of magnitude in rupture velocity.},

              Recent geodetic observations indicate that a single fault may slip slowly and silently or fast and seismically in different circumstances. We report laboratory experiments that demonstrate how the mode of faulting can alternate between fast “stick‐slip” events (70 to {\textasciitilde}500 mm/s sliding rates) and slow silent events ({\textasciitilde}0.001 to 30 mm/s) as a result of loading conditions rather than friction properties or stiffness of the loading machine. The 760 mm long granite sample is close to the critical nucleation length scale for unstable slip, so small variations in nucleation properties result in measurable differences in slip events. Slow events occur when instability cannot fully nucleate before reaching the sample ends. Dynamic events occur after long healing times or abrupt increases in loading rate which suggests that these factors shrink the spatial and temporal extents of the nucleation zone. Arrays of slip, strain, and ground motion sensors installed on the sample allow us to quantify seismic coupling and study details of premonitory slip and afterslip. We find that seismic coupling decreases when slip rates fall below about 70 mm/s. The slow slip events we observe are primarily aseismic (less than 1\% of the seismic coupling of faster events) and produce swarms of very small

               −6 to
              M
               −8 events. These mechanical and seismic interactions suggest that faults with transitional behavior—where creep, small earthquakes, and tremor are often observed—could become seismically coupled if loaded rapidly, either by a slow slip front or dynamic rupture of an earthquake that nucleated elsewhere.
            
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            Some faults slip slowly and silently, while others are locked and then slip spontaneously and generate destructive earthquakes. Recent observations show that a single fault may slip in either mode under different circumstances. We have conducted laboratory earthquake experiments where we force a fault cut in a 760 mm long granite rock to slip, similar to the way a natural fault slips in an earthquake. The experiments demonstrate that the same rock sample will either slip rapidly or slowly based on how quickly we apply force to it and how long we let the rock rest in between successive laboratory earthquakes. When the rock slips rapidly (70 to {\textasciitilde}500 mm/s), it generates vibrations that are similar to a magnitude −3 earthquake. When the rock slips slowly ({\textasciitilde}0.001 to 30 mm/s), most of the slip occurs silently. The vibrations that the slowly sliding rock does produce are a swarm of tiny earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from −6 down to at least −8 detected with instruments sensitive to nanometer‐scale displacements. Studying fault slip and vibrations in the laboratory will help us better understand the mechanics of natural earthquakes and other nearly silent tectonic processes that occur within the Earth.

              Seismic shear waves released by an earthquake typically far outpace motion along the fault surface. Occasionally, however, earthquakes along strike-slip faults appear to propagate so that the rupture velocity is faster than shear waves, creating a sort of sonic boom along the fault surface.

          , 
            Supershear earthquake ruptures propagate faster than the shear wave velocity. Although there is evidence that this occurs in nature, it has not been experimentally demonstrated with the use of crustal rocks. We performed stick-slip experiments with Westerly granite under controlled upper-crustal stress conditions. Supershear ruptures systematically occur when the normal stress exceeds 43 megapascals ({MPa}) with resulting stress drops on the order of 3 to 25 {MPa}, comparable to the stress drops inferred by seismology for crustal earthquakes. In our experiments, the sub-Rayleigh–to–supershear transition length is a few centimeters at most, suggesting that the rupture of asperities along a fault may propagate locally at supershear velocities. In turn, these sudden accelerations and decelerations could play an important role in the generation of high-frequency radiation and the overall rupture-energy budget.},

            The onset of sliding motion is conditional on the propagation of rupture fronts that detach the contacting asperities forming a frictional interface. These ruptures, when propagating over a fault surface, are the most common mechanism for an earthquake. Experimentally, the transition from static to sliding friction takes place when a rupture traverses the entire interface. But ruptures can also arrest before reaching the end of the interface. The determination of the mechanisms responsible for rupture arrest is of particular interest for understanding an earthquake's magnitude selection. Propagating ruptures have been shown to be true shear cracks, driven by singular fields at their tip, and fracture mechanics have been successfully used to describe rupture arrest along homogeneous frictional interfaces. Performing high temporal resolution measurements of the real contact area and strain fields, we demonstrate that the same framework provides an excellent quantitative description of rupture arrest along interfaces with heterogeneous fracture properties and complex stress distributions at a macroscopic scale. This work unravels the different mechanisms responsible for rupture arrest along model laboratory faults. This fracture‐based paradigm opens a window to a wide range of possible consequences for frictional behavior along any two contacting bodies; from the centimeter scale to the scale of natural faults.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            An earthquake is a rupture front propagating along a fault, which breaks the solid contacts formed between the two fault faces. Ruptures are often arrested before spanning the entire length of the fault. Rupture lengths relate to earthquake magnitudes; the longer the rupture, the higher the magnitude. The aim of this study is to understand what causes rupture arrest, hence, what selects an earthquake's size. We mimic a fault in the lab by pressing and shearing two solid blocks until sliding motion initiates. We demonstrate that an arrest criterion derived from fracture mechanics theory is valid to determine if and where a rupture will arrest. Our conclusion is that rupture arrest occurs because of either value of the applied stress, when properly weighted, or a localized increase of the fracture energy, that is, the energy dissipated during the rupture propagation, along the interface.

            Slow earthquakes represent an important conundrum in earthquake physics. While regular earthquakes are catastrophic events with rupture velocities governed by elastic wave speed, the processes that underlie slow fault slip phenomena, including recent discoveries of tremor, slow-slip and low-frequency earthquakes, are less understood. Theoretical models and sparse laboratory observations have provided insights, but the physics of slow fault rupture remain enigmatic. Here we report on laboratory observations that illuminate the mechanics of slow-slip phenomena. We show that a spectrum of slow-slip behaviours arises near the threshold between stable and unstable failure, and is governed by frictional dynamics via the interplay of fault frictional properties, effective normal stress and the elastic stiffness of the surrounding material. This generalizable frictional mechanism may act in concert with other hypothesized processes that damp dynamic ruptures, and is consistent with the broad range of geologic environments where slow earthquakes are observed.},

The transition from quasi‐static to accelerating rupture is related to the critical nucleation length, which scales inversely with normal stress in accordance with theoretical predictions, and to a critical surfacic power, which may be an intrinsic property of the interface. Finally, we discuss these results in the frame of previous studies and propose a scaling up to natural earthquake dimensions.

	abstract = {Surface topography is important as it influences contact load-carrying capacity and operational efficiency through generated friction, as well as wear. As a result, a plethora of machining processes and surface finishing techniques have been developed. These processes yield topographies, which are often non-Gaussian, with roughness parameters that alter hierarchically according to their interaction heights. They are also subject to change through processes of rapid initial running-in wear as well as any subsequent gradual wear and embedding. The stochastic nature of the topography makes for complexity of contact mechanics of rough surfaces, which was first addressed by the pioneering work of Greenwood and Williamson, which among other issues is commemorated by this contribution. It is shown that their seminal contribution, based on idealised Gaussian topography and mean representation of asperity geometry should be extended for practical applications where surfaces are often non-Gaussian, requiring the inclusion of surface-specific data which also evolve through process of wear. The paper highlights a process dealing with practical engineering surfaces from laboratory-based testing using a sliding tribometer to accelerated fired engine testing for high performance applications of cross-hatched honed cylinder liners. Such an approach has not hitherto been reported in literature.},

Further, a single-rough-surface model can always be found which will predict the same laws as a given two-rough-surface model, although the required model may be unrealistic. It does not seem possible to deduce the asperity shape or deformation mode from the load-compliance curve.},

	shorttitle = {Paper 24},
	abstract = {New developments in engineering and science in systems involving surfaces (friction, wear, contact deformation, reflection, electrical conductivity and resistance, heat transfer, tolerances and fits, etc.) require more comprehensive characterization of their micro- and macro-geometrical texture. Previous experience exhibits the fact that a statistical description of a surface by means of the first and second moment of the ordinate probability density distribution such as c.l.a. or r.m.s. and other parameters is not adequate.
            This paper discusses the more recent developments of surface characterization, considering a two- and/or three-dimensional random process by means' of the auto- and cross-correlation functions, power spectra, and the slope probability distribution parameters. A representative number of surfaces manufactured by a variety of metal-removal processes have been investigated in order to achieve, first, the differentiation of the surfaces with the same c.l.a. and r.m.s. values, and second, the separation of the periodic and random components in the surfaces. It is shown that the new techniques may disclose the differences in the internal structure of the surfaces.
            The elementary correlation functions, which may describe analytically the types of real surface profiles, are employed for the design of the surface topography system based on the correlation lengths and correlation wavelengths. On a number of practical examples there is shown the applicability of the proposed surface classification which is independent of the surface generation process.
            The theoretical approach and the experimental confirmation of the conclusions represent basically a new tool for comprehensive surface characterization. However, it should be considered that such a description requires a data requisition and processing by means of digital or special statistical computers. This circumstance does not affect the basic research work, but it is impractical for workshop application. Therefore new parameters and measuring methods have been developed to make the use of more comprehensive surface characterization methods possible in practice.},

The friction state variable is discussed, including its interpretation as a measure of average asperity contact time and porosity within granular fault gouge. Data are summarized showing that friction evolves even during truly stationary contact, and the connection between modern friction laws and the concept of “static” friction is discussed. Measurements of frictional healing, as evidenced by increasing static friction during quasistationary contact, are reviewed, as are their implications for fault healing. Shear localization in fault gouge is discussed, and the relationship between microstructures and friction is reviewed. These data indicate differences in the behavior of bare rock surfaces as compared to shear within granular fault gouge that can be attributed to dilation within fault gouge. Physical models for the characteristic friction distance are discussed and related to the problem of scaling this parameter to seismic faults. Earthquake afterslip, its relation to laboratory friction data, and the inverse correlation between afterslip and shallow coseismic slip are discussed in the context of a model for afterslip. Recent observations of the absence of afterslip are predicted by the model.},

	abstract = {Hydro-mechanical reservoir models are used to obtain quantitative insights into the spatial distribution of stress, strain and pore pressure. Recent studies have shown that different approaches to incorporate faults into such reservoir simulations have a profound impact on the modeling results. Since faults are a key feature in the subsurface affecting both the hydraulic and mechanical behavior of a reservoir, their proper implementation in the numerical model is crucial. Fault representation has to accurately model the effect faults have on (1) fluid flow and (2) the local stress field. However, a fault is not just a discrete geological feature but rather a fault zone with a complex geometry and various rock units with distinct material properties. This small-scale heterogeneity can hardly be represented in reservoir scale finite element models considering the typical grid size used in these simulations. Thus, fault representation in reservoir-scale hydro-mechanical simulations has to be based on simplifications and upscaling techniques. To improve decision making and help in choosing the right fault representation, knowledge about the different effects each simplification and each approach used to incorporate faults has on the modeling results is necessary. This thesis focuses on different approaches of fault representation with a single upscaled set of material properties in reservoir-scale hydro-mechanical finite element models. The main objectives are (1) Implementing the fault geometry with respect to the finite element grid properly (2) Addressing the scale differences between the internal heterogeneity of the fault zone (centimeters to meters) and the typical size of the calculation cells of the numerical grid (meters to tens of meters) accurately (3) Assigning fault material properties to the numerical models, which stem – if available at all – from rock mechanical testing on core samples with a diameter of a few centimeters and therefore require upscaling and merging techniques In order to meet these challenges three research articles were published, each based on simple generic fault zone models. The approaches analyzed to represent faults in reservoir-scale hydro-mechanical include a regular rectangular grid, a grid geometry adapted to the fault geometry as well as fault representation by contact elements. Fault representation as volumetric weak zones is investigated for different grid geometries, fault dip angles as well as different mesh resolutions inside the fault zone. In addition, the impact of different elastic and frictional fault zone properties is assessed. Differences and similarities in the calculated stress and strain patterns as well as the pore pressure field obtained from different fault implementation strategies are discussed and general recommendations concerning the implementation of faults in hydro-mechanical reservoir models are given. Fault representation as either volumetric weak zones or contact elements leads to significant differences in the stress and strain patterns in the vicinity of the fault zone (\&lt; 50 m). While fault dip is not of critical importance for fluid flow, it has a significant impact on the stress perturbation induced by the fault. Another important finding is that the mesh resolution has to be considered very carefully as – particularly in combination with a rectangular grid – interlocking effects and serious errors can occur. If, however, the focus of a modeling study is not in the vicinity of the fault zone, a rectangular grid with the appropriate mesh resolution allows for faster and easier model generation in comparison to a curvilinear grid adapted to the fault geometry. Regarding material parameters, Young's modulus and cohesion assigned to the fault zone have the most significant impact on the modeling results, while the internal friction angle and Poisson's ratio play a subordinate role. Overall, this thesis provides recommendations and guidelines to improve fault representation in reservoir simulations. The goal is to gain more realistic simulations and thus, more reliable modeling results to improve forecasts, lower costs and reduce risks during subsurface operations.},

Professor Johnson first reviews the development of the theory of contact stresses since the problem was originally addressed by H. Hertz in 1882. Next he discusses the influence of friction and the topographical roughness of surfaces, and this is incorporated into the theory of contact mechanics. An important feature is the treatment of bodies which deform plastically or viscoelastically. In addition to stationary contact, an appreciable section of the book is concerned with bodies which are in sliding or rolling contact, or which collide.},

	abstract = {Although the study of friction has a long history, ice friction has only been investigated during the last century. The basic physical concepts underlying the different friction regimes, such as boundary, mixed, and hydrodynamic friction are also relevant to ice friction. However, these friction regimes must be described with respect to the thickness of the lubricating liquidlike layer on ice. In this review the state of knowledge on the physics of ice friction is discussed. Surface melting theories are introduced. These theories attempt to explain the existence and nature of the liquidlike surface layer on ice at any temperature and without any load applied. Pressure melting, as the long-time explanation for the ease of ice friction, is discussed, together with the prevailing theory of frictional heating. The various laboratory setups for ice friction measurements are presented as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The individual influence of the different parameters on the coefficient of ice friction is discussed; these include the effects of temperature, sliding velocity, normal force exerted by the sliding object, the contact area between ice and slider, relative humidity, and also properties of the slider material such as surface roughness, surface structure, wettability, and thermal conductivity. Finally, the most important ice friction models based on the frictional heating theory are briefly introduced and research directions on the subject of ice friction are discussed.},

When the sliding speed is appreciable the friction falls to a low value, and experiments support the view, put forward earlier, that this low friction is due to a localized surface melting produced by frictional heating. Measurements are made on a variety of surfaces including metals, synthetic polymers and waxes. The contact angle which water makes with the surface is important, and there is evidence that this can decrease during sliding. In general, the solids with a high contact angle give a lower friction. The behaviour is also influenced by the relative hardness of ice and of the ski surface at the temperature of sliding.

Numerical solutions reproduced typical experimental results well.

              Experiments measuring friction over a wide range of sliding velocities find that the value of the friction coefficient varies widely: friction is high and behaves according to the rate and state constitutive law during slow sliding, yet markedly weakens as the sliding velocity approaches seismic slip speeds. We introduce a physics‐based theory to explain this behavior. Using conventional microphysics of creep, we calculate the velocity and temperature dependence of contact stresses during sliding, including the thermal effects of shear heating. Contacts are assumed to reach a coupled thermal and mechanical steady state, and friction is calculated for steady sliding. Results from theory provide good quantitative agreement with reported experimental results for quartz and granite friction over 11 orders of magnitude in velocity. The new model elucidates the physics of friction and predicts the connection between friction laws to independently determined material parameters. It predicts four frictional regimes as function of slip rate:
              at slow velocity
              friction is either velocity strengthening or weakening, depending on material parameters, and follows the rate and state friction law. Differences between surface and volume activation energies are the main control on velocity dependence. At
              intermediate velocity
              , for some material parameters, a distinct velocity strengthening regime emerges.
              At fast sliding
              , shear heating produces thermal softening of friction. At the
              fastest sliding
              , melting causes further weakening. This theory, with its four frictional regimes, fits well previously published experimental results under low temperature and normal stress.

            Plain Language Summary
            Experiments measuring friction over a wide range of sliding velocities find that the value of the friction coefficient varies widely: friction is high during slow sliding, yet markedly weakens as the sliding velocity rises to seismic slip rates. We introduce a physics‐based theory to explain this behavior. Our model assumes friction is controlled by creep at contacts that form between the sliding surfaces. It also assumes that when sliding is fast contacts heat up, and this affects friction profoundly. Our model is able to quantitatively predict, for the first time, reported experimental results for steady state friction at all experimentally measured slip rates. This is done using material parameters that are measured from other experiments, unrelated to friction. The new model may have far reaching implications for understanding friction in general and for earthquake physics in particular.

                  Friction of rocks depends on slip rate: it follows conventional rate and state during slow slip, yet markedly weakens as slip rates approach seismic speeds
                
                
                  Using conventional microphysics of creep, we develop a physics‐based model for steady state friction at all slip rates

              a
              , a parameter playing a central role in the {RSF} constitutive law, is much larger than the traditional, consensual estimate of less than about 0.01. We derive a lower bound of 0.035 for
              a
              directly from stress‐velocity relations measured during carefully designed step tests, without relying on any evolution laws as traditional methods do. After correcting for state changes during the steps, inferred indirectly from observed changes in acoustic transmissivities across the interface, we obtain an estimate of
              a
              as large as 0.05. Second, we calculate values of the {RSF} state variable Φ by feeding the measured shear stress and slip velocity values into the constitutive law. The results showed systematic deviations from predictions of the {RSF} evolution law of the aging type. This leads us to propose a revised evolution law, which incorporates a previously unknown weakening effect related to the shear stress. We also present additional experiment results to corroborate the presence of this new effect. Forward simulations based on our revised evolution law, combined with the larger, revised value of
              a
              , very well explain observed variations in both the shear stress and Φ throughout different phases of experiments, including quasi‐static hold, reloading after a hold, and steady state sliding at different velocities, as well as their mutual transitions, all with an identical set of parameter values.

We establish linear stability conditions for steady slip states (V(t), τ(t) constant). For single degree-of-freedom elastic or viscoelastic dynamical systems, instability occurs, if at all, by a flutter mode when the spring stiffness (or appropriate viscoelastic generalization) reduces to a critical value. Similar conclusions are reached for slipping continua with spatially periodic perturbations along their interface, and in this case the existence of propagating frictional creep waves is established at critical conditions. Increases in inertia of the slipping systems are found to be destabilizing, in that they increase the critical stiffness level required for stability.},

Recent work by Boatwright et. al. (2006) provides {MMI}-based {ShakeMap} estimates of spectral response accelerations derived from observations of intensities in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. This paper calculates damage and loss estimates using those estimated ground motions, then compares the resulting estimates with those calculated using a method parallel with that of current seismic provisions of building codes for a magnitude M7.9 event on the San Andreas Fault, and contrasts differences in damage and loss patterns for these two scenarios. The study region of interest comprises 19 counties of the greater San Francisco Bay Area and adjacent areas of Northern California, covering 24,000 square miles, with a population of more than ten million people and about \$1.5 trillion of building and contents exposure. The majority of this property and population is within 40 km (25 miles) of the San Andreas Fault. The current population of this Northern California region is about ten times what it was in 1906, and the replacement value of buildings is about 500 times greater. Despite improvements in building codes and construction practices, the growth of the region over the past 100 years causes the range of estimated fatalities, approximately 800–3,400 depending on time of day and other variables, to be comparable to what it was in 1906. The forecast property loss to buildings for a repeat of the 1906 earthquake is in the range of approximately \$90–120 billion; 7,000–10,000 commercial buildings in the region are estimated to be closed due to serious damage; and about 160,000–250,000 households calculated to be displaced from damaged residences. Losses due to fire following earthquake, as well as losses to utility and transportation systems, would be in addition to these estimates.},

	abstract = {In the course of an investigation of the effect of surface scratches on the mechanical strength of solids, some general conclusions were reached which appear to have a direct bearing on the problem of rupture, from an engineering standpoint, and also on the larger question of the nature of intermolecular cohesion. The original object of the work, which was carried out at the Royal Aircraft Estab­lishment, was the discovery of the effect of surface treatment—such as, for instance, filing, grinding or polishing—on the strength of metallic machine parts subjected to alternating or repeated loads. In the case of steel, and some other metals in common use, the results of fatigue tests indicated that the range of alternating stress which could be permanently sustained by the material was smaller than the range within which it was sensibly elastic, after being subjected to a great number of reversals. Hence it was inferred that the safe range of loading of a part, having a scratched or grooved surface of a given type, should be capable of estimation with the help of one of the two hypotheses of rupture commonly used for solids which are elastic to fracture. According to these hypotheses rupture may be expected if (a) the maximum tensile stress, (
              b
              ) the maximum extension, exceeds a certain critical value. Moreover, as the behaviour of the materials under consideration, within the safe range of alternating stress, shows very little departure from Hooke’s law, it was thought that the necessary stress and strain calculations could be performed by means of the mathematical theory of elasticity.},

            A substantial fraction of the mysteries associated with crack extension might be eliminated if the description of fracture experiments could include some reasonable estimate of the stress conditions near the leading edge of a crack particularly at points of onset of rapid fracture and at points of fracture arrest. It is pointed out that for somewhat brittle tensile fractures in situations such that a generalized plane-stress or a plane-strain analysis is appropriate, the influence of the test configuration, loads, and crack length upon the stresses near an end of the crack may be expressed in terms of two parameters. One of these is an adjustable uniform stress parallel to the direction of a crack extension. It is shown that the other parameter, called the stress-intensity factor, is proportional to the square root of the force tending to cause crack extension. Both factors have a clear interpretation and field of usefulness in investigations of brittle-fracture mechanics.},

	abstract = {The onset of frictional instabilities, e.g., earthquakes nucleation, is intimately related to velocity‐weakening friction, in which the frictional resistance of interfaces decreases with increasing slip velocity. While this frictional response has been studied extensively, less attention has been given to steady state velocity‐strengthening friction, in spite of its potential importance for various aspects of frictional phenomena such as the propagation speed of interfacial rupture fronts and the amount of stored energy released by them. In this note we suggest that a crossover from steady state velocity‐weakening friction at small slip velocities to steady state velocity‐strengthening friction at higher velocities might be a generic feature of dry friction. We further argue that while thermally activated rheology naturally gives rise to logarithmic steady state velocity‐strengthening friction, a crossover to stronger‐than‐logarithmic strengthening might take place at higher slip velocities, possibly accompanied by a change in the dominant dissipation mechanism. We sketch a few physical mechanisms that may account for the crossover to stronger‐than‐logarithmic steady state velocity strengthening and compile a rather extensive set of experimental data available in the literature, lending support to these ideas.

Recent geophysical and laboratory observations indicated that interfacial failure can be mediated by slow slip rupture phenomena which are distinct from ordinary, earthquake‐like, fast rupture. These discoveries have influenced the way we think about frictional motion, yet the nature and properties of slow rupture are not completely understood. We show that slow rupture is an intrinsic and robust property of simple non‐monotonic rate‐and‐state friction laws. It is associated with a new velocity scale
              c
              min
              , determined by the friction law, below which steady state rupture cannot propagate. We further show that rupture can occur in a continuum of states, spanning a wide range of velocities from
              c
              min
              to elastic wave‐speeds, and predict different properties for slow rupture and ordinary fast rupture. Our results are qualitatively consistent with recent high‐resolution laboratory experiments and may provide a theoretical framework for understanding slow rupture phenomena along frictional interfaces.

              We report macroscopic stick‐slip events in saw‐cut Westerly granite samples deformed under controlled upper crustal stress conditions in the laboratory. Experiments were conducted under triaxial loading (

              3
              ) ranging from 10 to 100 {MPa}. A high‐frequency acoustic monitoring array recorded particle acceleration during macroscopic stick‐slip events allowing us to estimate rupture speed. In addition, we record the stress drop dynamically and we show that the dynamic stress drop measured locally close to the fault plane is almost total in the breakdown zone (for normal stress {\textgreater}75 {MPa}), while the friction
              f
              recovers to values of
              f
              {\textgreater} 0.4 within only a few hundred microseconds. Enhanced dynamic weakening is observed to be linked to the melting of asperities which can be well explained by flash heating theory in agreement with our postmortem microstructural analysis. Relationships between initial state of stress, rupture velocities, stress drop, and energy budget suggest that at high normal stress (leading to supershear rupture velocities), the rupture processes are more dissipative. Our observations question the current dichotomy between the fracture energy and the frictional energy in terms of rupture processes. A power law scaling of the fracture energy with final slip is observed over 8 orders of magnitude in slip, from a few microns to tens of meters.

              We present a series of high‐velocity friction tests conducted on Westerly granite, using the Slow to {HIgh} Velocity Apparatus ({SHIVA}) installed at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia Roma with acoustic emissions ({AEs}) monitored at high frequency (4 {MHz}). Both atmospheric humidity and pore fluid (water) pressure conditions were tested, under effective normal stress
              
              in the range 5–20 {MPa} and at target sliding velocities

              in the range 0.003–3 m/s. Under atmospheric humidity two consecutive friction drops were observed. The first one is related to flash weakening, and the second one to the formation and growth of a continuous layer of melt in the slip zone. In the presence of fluid, a single drop in friction was observed. Average values of fracture energy are independent of effective normal stress and sliding velocity. However, measurements of elastic wave velocities on the sheared samples suggested that larger damage was induced for 0.1 {\textless}

                s
              
              {\textless}0.3 m/s. This observation is supported by {AEs} recorded during the test, most of which were detected after the initiation of the second friction drop, once the fault surface temperature was high. Some {AEs} were detected up to a few seconds after the end of the experiments, indicating thermal rather than mechanical cracking. In addition, the presence of pore water delayed the onset of {AEs} by cooling effects and by reducing of the heat produced, supporting the link between {AEs} and the production and diffusion of heat during sliding. Using a thermoelastic crack model developed by Fredrich and Wong (1986), we confirm that damage may be induced by heat diffusion. Indeed, our theoretical results predict accurately the amount of shortening and shortening rate, supporting the idea that gouge production and gouge comminution are in fact largely controlled by thermal cracking. Finally, we discuss the contribution of thermal cracking in the seismic energy balance. In fact, while a dichotomy exists in the literature regarding the partitioning between fracture and heat energy, the experimental evidence reported here suggests that both contribute to fault weakening and off‐fault damage.

            Radon‐222, a radioactive gas naturally produced in the Earth's crust, informs us about the migration of fluids and is sometimes considered as a potential earthquake precursor. Here we investigate the effects of mechanical and thermal damage on the radon emanation from various granites representative of the upper crust. Radon concentration measurements performed under triaxial stress and pore fluid pressure show that mechanical damage resulting from cycles of differential stress intensifies radon release up to 170 ± 22\% when the sample ruptures. This radon peak is transient and results from the connection of isolated micropores to the permeable network rather than new crack surface creation per se. Heating to 850°C shows that thermal fracturing irreversibly decreases emanation by 59–97\% due to the amorphization of biotites hosting radon sources. This study, and the developed protocols, shed light on the relation between radon emanation of crustal rocks, deformation, and pressure‐temperature conditions.

	abstract = {Subduction zones are where sediments, oceanic crust, and mantle lithosphere return to and reequilibrate with Earth's mantle. Subduction zones are interior expressions of Earth's 55,000 km of convergent plate margins and are the geodynamic system that builds island arcs. Excess density of the mantle lithosphere in subduction zones provides most of the power needed to move the plates while inducing convection in the overriding mantle wedge. Asthenospheric mantle sucked toward the trench by the sinking slab interacts with water and incompatible elements rising from the sinking plate, and this interaction causes the mantle to melt. These melts rise vertically through downwelling mantle to erupt at arc volcanoes. Subduction zones are thus interior Earth systems of unparalleled scale and complexity. Subduction zone igneous activity formed most ore deposits and continental crust, and earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate present a growing hazard to society. This overview summarizes our present understanding of subduction zones, using perspectives of the incoming plate, downgoing plate, mantle wedge, and arc‐trench complex. Understanding the operation of subduction zones stands as one of the great challenges facing the Earth sciences in the 21st century and will require the efforts of global interdisciplinary teams.},

Such compression explains recent uplift of the Coast Ranges and the numerous active reverse faults and folds that trend nearly parallel to the San Andreas and that are otherwise unexplainable in terms of strike-slip deformation. Fault-normal crustal compression in central California is proposed to result from the extremely low shear strength of the San Andreas and the slightly convergent relative motion between the Pacific and North American plates. Preliminary in situ stress data from the Cajon Pass scientific drill hole (located 3.6 kilometers northeast of the San Andreas in southern California near San Bernardino, California) are also consistent with a weak fault, as they show no right-lateral shear stress at ∼2-kilometer depth on planes parallel to the San Andreas fault.},

	abstract = {It has been noted that the spatial distribution of earthquakes and the mode of strain release in the San Andreas fault system is related to the complexity of fault geometry. Because of their rough appearance over many length scales, faults can be regarded as fractal surfaces. Direct estimates of fractal dimension D of portions of the San Andreas fault system between the northern Gabilan Range and the Salton Sea, including the postulated extent of the great 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, are obtained from measured fault lengths, analogous to the lengths of coastlines as discussed by Mandelbrot. Regions characterized by complicated fault geometry are associated with larger values of D. Based on fault traces mapped at a scale of 1:750,000, D is 1.3 for this reach of the fault defined as a 30-km-wide band about a main fault trace. For that part near Parkfield which could be associated with the nucleation of the 1857 earthquake, D is 1.1; at this same scale, D is 1.4 for the San Andreas and related faults near San Bernardino where the 1857 rupture stopped, compared to 1.2 for the San Andreas-San Juan fault segments near the point of arrest of the 1966 Parkfield earthquake. At finer map scales (1:24,000 and 1:62,500) critical lengths of ∼ 500 m and 1 km are identified which might relate to the extent of off-San Andreas fault offsets. The critical lengths also suggest that fault geometry is not self-similar. If this fractal geometry persists through the seismic cycle, it may be possible to use a quantitative measure of complexity to explain the occurrence of great and characteristic earthquakes along a given reach of fault.},

	abstract = {We compare 2-D, quasi-static earthquake nucleation on rate-and-state faults under both “aging” and “slip” versions of the state evolution law. For both versions mature nucleation zones exhibit 2 primary regimes of growth: Well above and slightly above steady state, corresponding respectively to larger and smaller fault weakening rates. Well above steady state, aging-law nucleation takes the form of accelerating slip on a patch of fixed length. This length is proportional to b−1 and independent of a, where a and b are the constitutive parameters relating changes in slip speed and state to frictional strength. Under the slip law the nucleation zone is smaller and continually shrinks as slip accelerates. The nucleation zone is guaranteed to remain well above steady state only for values of a/b that are low by laboratory standards. Near steady state, for both laws the nucleation zone expands. The propagating front remains well above steady state, giving rise to a simple expression for its effective fracture energy Gc. This fracture energy controls the propagation style. For the aging law Gc increases approximately as the square of the logarithm of the velocity jump. This causes the nucleation zone to undergo quasi-static crack-like expansion, to a size asymptotically proportional to b/(b−a)2. For the slip law Gc increases only as the logarithm of the velocity jump, and crack-like expansion is not an option. Instead, the nucleation zone grows as an accelerating unidirectional slip pulse. Under both laws the nucleation front propagates at a velocity larger than the slip speed by roughly μ′/bσ divided by the logarithm of the velocity jump, where μ′ is the effective elastic shear modulus. For this prediction to be consistent with observed propagation speeds of slow slip events in subduction zones appears to require effective normal stresses as low as 1 {MPa}.},

                    applied in the field. The present criterion for recognizing fault breccia as
                    having no ‘primary cohesion’ is often difficult to assess.
                    Instead we propose that fault breccia should be defined, as with sedimentary
                    breccia, primarily by grain size: with at least 30\% of its volume comprising
                    clasts at least 2 mm in diameter. To subdivide fault breccias, we advocate the
                    use of textural terms borrowed from the cave-collapse literature –
                    crackle, mosaic and chaotic breccia – with bounds at 75\% and 60\%
                    clast content. A secondary breccia discriminant, more difficult to apply in the
                    field, is the ratio of cement to matrix between the clasts. Clast-size issues

Earthquake magnitudes were redetermined as necessary to make them as consistent as possible with the Gutenberg methods and results, which make up much of the data base. Measurement errors were estimated for the three variables for 58 moderate to large shallow-focus earthquakes. Regression analyses were then made utilizing the estimated measurement errors.The regression analysis demonstrates that the relations among the variables magnitude, length, and displacement are stochastic in nature. The stochastic variance, introduced in part by incomplete surface expression of seismogenic faulting, variation in shear modulus, and regional factors, dominates the estimated measurement errors. Thus, it is appropriate to use ordinary least squares for the regression models, rather than regression models based upon an underlying deterministic relation in which the variance results primarily from measurement errors.Significant differences exist in correlations of certain combinations of length, displacement, and magnitude when events are grouped by fault type or by region, including attenuation regions delineated by Evernden and others.Estimates of the magnitude and the standard deviation of the magnitude of a prehistoric or future earthquake associated with a fault can be made by correlating Ms with the logarithms of rupture length, fault displacement, or the product of length and displacement.Fault rupture area could be reliably estimated for about 20 of the events in the data set. Regression of Ms on rupture area did not result in a marked improvement over regressions that did not involve rupture area. Because no subduction-zone earthquakes are included in this study, the reported results do not apply to such zones.},

            This supersedes Paper 1 (Gutenberg and Richter, 1942). Additional data are presented. Revisions involving intensity and acceleration are minor. The equation log a = I/3 − 1/2 is retained. The magnitude-energy relation is revised as follows:
            (20) log ⁡ E = 9.4 + 2.14 M − 0.054 M 2
            A numerical equivalent, for M from 1 to 8.6, is
            (21) log ⁡ E = 9.1 + 1.75 M + log ⁡ ( 9 − M )
            Equation (20) is based on
            (7) log ⁡ ( A 0 / T 0 ) = − 0.76 + 0.91 M − 0.027 M 2
            applying at an assumed point epicenter. Eq. (7) is derived empirically from readings of torsion seismometers and {USCGS} accelerographs. Amplitudes at the {USCGS} locations have been divided by an average factor of 2 1/2 to compensate for difference in ground; previously this correction was neglected, and log E was overestimated by 0.8. The terms M2 are due partly to the response of the torsion seismometers as affected by increase of ground period with M, partly to the use of surface waves to determine M. If {MS} results from surface waves, {MB} from body waves, approximately
            (27) M S − M B = 0.4 ( M S − 7 )
            It appears that {MB} corresponds more closely to the magnitude scale determined for local earthquakes.
            A complete revision of the magnitude scale, with appropriate tables and charts, is in preparation. This will probably be based on A/T rather than amplitudes.},

	abstract = {abstract
            As {MS}, mb, or unified magnitude approaches 8, there is an abrupt change in the rate at which frequency of occurrence decreases with magnitude. This change is not observed for moment-magnitude, {MW}. Data on past earthquakes are insufficient to prove whether there is a finite upper limit on {MS}, mb, or unified magnitude or whether earthquake probability is better described by an unlimited logarithmic relation of the form
            M = E + F ( I n ( G − I n ( − I n probability ) ) ) .
            This empirical equation, however, fits the world data best.
            If there is an upper limit on size, it is approximately 8.1 for mb, 8.7 for {MS}, and 8.9 for unified magnitude.
            For regions such as the contiguous United States and Alaska, there are too few large earthquakes for saturation to be clearly observed, but the data at large magnitudes fit an empirical equation of shape
            M = A + ( M max − A ) tanh ( C X − D )
            better than either the Gumbel I or {III} theory. This equation provides for a more sudden saturation than Gumbel's theory allows.},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of Earth structure can be used to distinguish far‐field seismic signals from near‐field noise. In particular, earthquakes excite ground motion at the eigenfrequencies of the Earth's normal modes. By observing the spectral levels in small bands centered on the known frequencies of the normal mode resonance peaks and comparing them to the spectral levels of ambient noise, it is possible to detect earthquakes at low frequencies without knowing anything about them at high frequencies. We have used this fact to develop an earthquake detection algorithm that compares the signal level in the mode bands, as measured by the modulus of zeroth‐order moment of the Fourier spectrum, with that in the noise bands using an
              F
              test. The excitation of each mode over a global network of stations and of all the modes over the network is evaluated from a summed‐score statistic using a binomial test and a Markov test, respectively, which are robust with respect to deviations from the Gaussian noise model. We apply the technique to the Earth's fundamental spheroidal modes

Slow earthquakes, i.e., those having anomalously large characteristic durations, are observed to be enriched in low‐frequency mode excitation relative to other events of comparable magnitude. Using this criterion, we have found a number of slow earthquakes that had not been previously identified as anomalous. Most of these newly identified slow earthquakes occurred on oceanic transform faults. In addition to the cataloged normal and slow earthquakes, we observe 27 episodes of substantial mode excitation that are reasonably well isolated from significant earthquakes. Such anomalies may represent “silent earthquakes,” events with propagation velocities sufficiently low that they do not generate globally detectable wave trains on high‐frequency seismometers.},

            In an earlier paper it was suggested that a knowledge of the elastic-stress variation in the neighborhood of an angular corner of an infinite plate would perhaps be of value in analyzing the stress distribution at the base of a V-notch. As a part of a more general study, the specific case of a zero-angle notch, or crack, was carried out to supplement results obtained by other investigators. This paper includes remarks upon the antisymmetric, as well as symmetric, stress distribution, and the circumferential distribution of distortion strain-energy density. For the case of a symmetrical loading about the crack, it is shown that the energy density is not a maximum along the direction of the crack but is one third higher at an angle ± cos−1 (1/3); i.e., approximately ±70 deg. It is shown that at the base of the crack in the direction of its prolongation, the principal stresses are equal, thus tending toward a state of (two-dimensional) hydrostatic tension. As the distance from the point of the crack increases, the distortion strain energy increases, suggesting the possibility of yielding ahead of the crack as well as ±70 deg to the sides. The maximum principal tension stress occurs on ±60 deg rays. For the antisymmetrical stress distribution the distortion strain energy is a relative maximum along the crack and 60 per cent lower ± 85 deg to the sides.},

            Earthquakes occur in clusters or sequences that arise from complex triggering mechanisms, but direct measurement of the slow subsurface slip responsible for delayed triggering is rarely possible. We investigate the origins of complexity and its relationship to heterogeneity using an experimental fault with two dominant seismic asperities. The fault is composed of quartz powder, a material common to natural faults, sandwiched between 760 mm long polymer blocks that deform the way 10 meters of rock would behave. We observe periodic repeating earthquakes that transition into aperiodic and complex sequences of fast and slow events. Neighboring earthquakes communicate via migrating slow slip, which resembles creep fronts observed in numerical simulations and on tectonic faults. Utilizing both local stress measurements and numerical simulations, we observe that the speed and strength of creep fronts are highly sensitive to fault stress levels left behind by previous earthquakes, and may serve as on-fault stress meters.},

            Slow slip events ({SSEs}) accommodate a significant proportion of tectonic plate motion at subduction zones, yet little is known about the faults that actually host them. The shallow depth ({\textless}2 km) of well-documented {SSEs} at the Hikurangi subduction zone offshore New Zealand offers a unique opportunity to link geophysical imaging of the subduction zone with direct access to incoming material that represents the megathrust fault rocks hosting slow slip. Two recent International Ocean Discovery Program Expeditions sampled this incoming material before it is entrained immediately down-dip along the shallow plate interface. Drilling results, tied to regional seismic reflection images, reveal heterogeneous lithologies with highly variable physical properties entering the {SSE} source region. These observations suggest that {SSEs} and associated slow earthquake phenomena are promoted by lithological, mechanical, and frictional heterogeneity within the fault zone, enhanced by geometric complexity associated with subduction of rough crust.},

              Geodetic observations and large‐scale laboratory experiments show that seismic instability is preceded by slow slip within a finite nucleation zone. In laboratory experiments rupture nucleation is studied mostly using bare (rock) interfaces, whereas upper crustal faults are typically filled with gouge. To investigate effects of gouge on rupture nucleation, we performed a biaxial shearing experiment on a 350 mm long saw‐cut fault filled with gypsum gouge, at room temperature and a minimum horizontal stress

               = 0.3–5 {MPa}. The gouge layer was sandwiched between polymethylmethacrylate ({PMMA}) plates For reference also a fault without gouge was deformed. Strain gauges and Digital Image Correlation were used to monitor the deformation field along the fault zone margins. Stick‐slip behavior occurred on both the gouge‐filled fault and the {PMMA} fault. Nucleation of instability on the {PMMA} fault persistently occurred from one location 2/3 to 3/4 along the fault adjacent to a slow slip zone at the fault end, but nucleation on the gouge‐filled fault was more variable, nucleating at the ends and/or at approximately 2/3 along the fault, with precursory slip occurring over a large fraction of the fault. Nucleation correlated to regions of high average fault stress ratio

            Active faults release elastic strain energy via a whole continuum of modes of slip, ranging from devastating earthquakes to slow slip events ({SSEs}) and persistent creep. Understanding the mechanisms controlling the occurrence of rapid, dynamic slip radiating seismic waves (i.e., earthquakes) or slow, silent slip (i.e., {SSEs}) is a fundamental point in the estimation of seismic hazard along subduction zones. In this paper, we use numerical models of the seismic cycle (interseismic, coseismic, and postseismic) that account for the geometry and stress transfers of faults. We argue that the spontaneous occurrence, the characteristics, and the scaling relationship of {SSEs} and earthquakes emerge from geometrical complexities. The geometry of active faults should be considered as a complementary mechanism to current numerical models of {SSEs} and fast earthquakes.

It is commonly believed that the maximum static friction force is proportional to the loading force and does not depend on the apparent contact area. The ratio of the maximum static friction force to the loading force is called the static friction coefficient µM, which is considered to be a constant. Here, we conduct experiments demonstrating that the static friction force of a slider on a substrate follows a novel friction law under certain conditions. The magnitude of µM decreases as the loading force increases or as the apparent contact area decreases. This behavior is caused by the slip of local precursors before the onset of bulk sliding and is consistent with recent theory. The results of this study will develop novel methods for static friction control.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments indicate that frictional sliding occurs by nucleation of detachment fronts at the contact interface that may appear well before the onset of global sliding. This intriguing precursory activity is not accounted for by traditional friction theories but is extremely important for friction dominated geophysical phenomena as earthquakes, landslides or avalanches. Here we simulate the onset of slip of a three dimensional elastic body resting on a surface and show that experimentally observed frictional precursors depend in a complex non-universal way on the sample geometry and loading conditions. Our model satisfies Archard's law and Amontons' first and second laws, reproducing with remarkable precision the real contact area dynamics, the precursors' envelope dynamics prior to sliding and the normal and shear internal stress distributions close to the interfacial surface. Moreover, it allows to assess which features can be attributed to the elastic equilibrium and which are attributed to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics, suggesting that precursory activity is an intrinsically quasi-static physical process. A direct calculation of the evolution of the Coulomb stress before and during precursors nucleation shows large variations across the sample, explaining why earthquake forecasting methods based only on accumulated slip and Coulomb stress monitoring are often ineffective.},

	abstract = {It has been known for a long time that slip accompanying earthquakes accounts for only a fraction of plate tectonic displacements. However, only recently has a fuller spectrum of strain release processes, including normal, slow, and silent earthquakes (or slow slip events) and continuous and episodic slip, been observed and generated by numerical simulations of the earthquake cycle. Despite a profusion of observations and modeling studies the physical mechanism of slow slip events remains elusive. The concurrence of seismic tremor with slow slip episodes in Cascadia and southwestern Japan provides insight into the process of slow slip. A perceived similarity between subduction zone and volcanic tremor has led to suggestions that slow slip involves fluid migration on or near the plate interface. Alternatively, evidence is accumulating to support the notion that tremor results from shear failure during slow slip. Global observations of the location, spatial extent, magnitude, duration, slip rate, and periodicity of these aseismic slip transients indicate significant variation that may be exploited to better understand their generation. Most slow slip events occur just downdip of the seismogenic zone, consistent with rate- and state-dependent frictional modeling that requires unstable to stable transitional properties for slow slip generation. At a few convergent margins the occurrence of slow slip events within the seismogenic zone makes it highly likely that transitions in frictional properties exist there and are the loci of slow slip nucleation. Slow slip events perturb the surrounding stress field and may either increase or relieve stress on a fault, bringing it closer to or farther from earthquake failure, respectively. This paper presents a review of slow slip events and related seismic tremor observed at plate boundaries worldwide, with a focus on circum-Pacific subduction zones. Trends in global observations of slow slip events suggest that (1) slow slip is a common phenomena observed at almost all subduction zones with instrumentation capable of recording it, (2) different frictional properties likely control fast versus slow slip, (3) the depth range of slow slip may be related to the thermal properties of the plate interface, and (4) the equivalent seismic moment of slow slip events is proportional to their duration (Moατ), different from the Moατ3 scaling observed for earthquakes.},

Tectonic faults also fail in slow earthquakes with rupture durations of months or more, yet their origin is poorly understood. Here, we present laboratory observations of repetitive, slow stick-slip in serpentinite fault zones and mechanical evidence for their origin. We document a transition from unstable to stable frictional behavior with increasing slip velocity, providing a mechanism to limit the speed of slow earthquakes. We also document reduction of P-wave speed within the active shear zone before stick-slip events. If similar mechanisms operate in nature, our results suggest that higher-resolution studies of elastic properties in tectonic fault zones may aid in the search for reliable earthquake precursors.},

	abstract = {To investigate the possible physical mechanisms of recently observed aseismic slip events in the Cascadia, Japan and Mexico subduction zones, we apply a Dieterich-Ruina rate and state friction law to a three dimensional model of a shallow subduction fault. That is loaded by imposed steady plate slip rate far downdip along the thrust interface. Friction properties are temperature and hence depth-dependent, such that sliding is stable at depths below about 30 km. The system is perturbed into a significantly nonuniform slip mode along strike by introducing small along-strike variations in the constitutive parameters a and (a − b). In addition to large heterogeneous earthquake slip at seismogenic depths, and associated postseismic transients, we found that slip events which have clearly aseismic slip rates emerge spontaneously around the downdip end of the seismogenic zone. Both transients which start well after a seismic event, and those which are triggered by other transients, are observed from the simulations. The slip velocity, depth range, and, sometimes, along-strike migration speed of simulated transients are similar to the observations from natural subduction zones. Unstable-stable transitional friction properties near the downdip end of the seismogenic zone are suggested to be an ingredient allowing such transients. Simulated transients can weaken the locking intensity of the updip seismogenic zone, while enhancing that of the transition zone. Spatial-temporal correlation of aseismic transients and nearby seismicity in the Guerrero, Mexico, area suggests that transients may signal a period of increased probability for nucleating their high-frequency counterparts, as damaging subduction thrust events.},

The time history of quasi-static slip along the plate interface, based on small repeating earthquakes that were part of the migrating seismicity, suggests that two sequences involved slow-slip transients propagating toward the initial rupture point. The second sequence, which involved large slip rates, may have caused substantial stress loading, prompting the unstable dynamic rupture of the mainshock.},

Second, we reproduce at the scale of the laboratory the complete spectrum of rupture velocities observed in nature. Our results show that the rupture velocity can range from a few millimetres to kilometres per second, depending on the available energy at the onset of slip, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

The coseismic model shows that the Sunda subduction megathrust  ruptured over a distance of about 1500 km and a width of less than 150 km,  releasing a total moment of 6.7–7.0 × 1022 N m, equivalent to a magnitude Mw ∼9.15. The latitudinal distribution of released moment in our model has three distinct  peaks at about 4° N, 7° N, and 9° N, which compares well to the latitudinal variations  seen in the seismic inversion and of the analysis of radiated T waves. Our coseismic  model is also consistent with interpretation of normal modes and with the amplitude  of very-long-period surface waves. The tsunami predicted from this model fits relatively  well the altimetric measurements made by the jason and topex satellites.  Neither slow nor delayed slip is needed to explain the normal modes and the tsunami  wave. The near-field geodetic data that encompass both coseismic deformation and up to 40 days of postseismic deformation require that slip must have continued on  the plate interface after the 500-sec-long seismic rupture. The postseismic geodetic  moment of about 2.4 × 1022 N m (Mw ∼8.8) is equal to about 30 ± 5\% of the  coseismic moment release. Evolution of postseismic deformation is consistent with  rate-strengthening frictional afterslip.Online material: Summary of geodetic data used in this study.},

It mainly comes from the concept of “self-organized criticality” ({SOC}), where criticality is interpreted in the way that, at any moment, any small avalanche can eventually cascade into a large event. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates experimentally the possibility of avalanche prediction in the classical paradigm of {SOC}: a pile of grains. By knowing the position of every grain in a two-dimensional pile, avalanches of moving grains follow a distinct power-law distribution. Large avalanches, although uncorrelated, are on average preceded by continuous, detectable variations in the internal structure of the pile that are monitored in order to achieve prediction.},

We vary particle size distribution, grain and surface roughness, and gouge layer thickness to better understand how grain sliding, rolling, dilation, and compaction affect the strength and stability of granular fault gouge. The experiments employed the double direct shear testing geometry and were run at room temperature, controlled humidity, and shearing rates from 0.1 to 3000 μm/s. Experiments were carried out under constant normal stress of 5 and 10 {MPa} and thus within a nonfracture loading regime where sliding friction for smooth, spherical particles is measurably lower than for rough, angular particles. We compare results from shear between smooth boundaries, where we hypothesize that grain boundary sliding is the dominant deformation mechanism, and roughened surfaces, where rolling and granular dilation contribute to shear deformation. We find that particle angularity and bounding surface roughness increase the frictional strength within sheared layers, indicating differences in particle reorganization due to these factors. In gouge material composed of {\textless}30\% angular grains we observe repetitive stick-slip sliding where stress drop decreases while preinstability creep increases with increasing gouge layer thickness. Our data show significant differences in stick-slip characteristics as a function of gouge layer thickness and particle size, which we interpret in terms of the mechanics of grain bridges that support forces on the layers. We suggest that force chains exhibit qualitative differences as a function of grain angularity and bounding surface roughness.},

	abstract = {Earthquake forecasting and prediction have long and in some cases sordid histories but recent work has rekindled interest based on advances in early warning, hazard assessment for induced seismicity and successful prediction of laboratory earthquakes. In the lab, frictional stick-slip events provide an analog for earthquakes and the seismic cycle. Labquakes are also ideal targets for machine learning ({ML}) because they can be produced in long sequences under controlled conditions. Indeed, recent works show that {ML} can predict several aspects of labquakes using fault zone acoustic emissions ({AE}). Here, we extend these works with: 1) deep learning ({DL}) methods for labquake prediction, 2) by introducing an autoregressive ({AR}) forecasting {DL} method to predict fault zone shear stress, and 3) by expanding the range of lab fault zones studied. The {AR} methods allow forecasting stress at future times via iterative predictions using previous measurements. Our {DL} methods outperform existing {ML} models and can predict based on limited training. We also explore forecasts beyond a single seismic cycle for aperiodic failure. We describe significant improvements to existing methods of labquake prediction and demonstrate: 1) that {DL} models based on Long-Short Term Memory and Convolution Neural Networks predict labquakes under conditions including pre-seismic creep, aperiodic events and alternating slow/fast events and 2) that fault zone stress can be predicted with fidelity, confirming that acoustic energy is a fingerprint of fault zone stress. Our {DL} methods predict time to start of failure ({TTsF}) and time to the end of Failure ({TTeF}) for labquakes. Interestingly, {TTeF} is successfully predicted in all seismic cycles, while the {TTsF} prediction varies with the amount of preseismic fault creep. We report {AR} methods to forecast the evolution of fault stress using three sequence modelling frameworks: {LSTM}, Temporal Convolution Network and Transformer Network. {AR} forecasting is distinct from existing predictive models, which predict only a target variable at a specific time. The results for forecasting beyond a single seismic cycle are limited but encouraging. Our {ML}/{DL} models outperform the state-of-the-art and our autoregressive model represents a novel framework that could enhance current methods of earthquake forecasting.},

We find scale-free distributions for these global and local avalanches denoted by power laws whose cutoffs vary with interparticle friction and packing fraction. Different exponents are found for these power laws depending on the quantity from which variations are extracted. An asymmetry in time of the avalanche shapes is evidenced along with the fact that avalanches are mainly triggered by the shear bands. A simple relation independent of the intensity is found between the number of local avalanches and the global avalanches they form. We also compare these experimental and numerical results for both local and global fluctuations to predictions from mean-field and depinning theories.},

	abstract = {This overview paper considers the East African rift system ({EARS}) as an intra-continental ridge system, comprising an axial rift. It describes the structural organization in three branches, the overall morphology, lithospheric cross-sections, the morphotectonics, the main tectonic features—with emphasis on the tension fractures—and volcanism in its relationships with the tectonics. The most characteristic features in the {EARS} are narrow elongate zones of thinned continental lithosphere related to asthenospheric intrusions in the upper mantle. This hidden part of the rift structure is expressed on the surface by thermal uplift of the rift shoulders. The graben valleys and basins are organized over a major failure in the lithospheric mantle, and in the crust comprise a major border fault, linked in depth to a low angle detachment fault, inducing asymmetric roll-over pattern, eventually accompanied by smaller normal faulting and tilted blocks. Considering the kinematics, divergent movements caused the continent to split along lines of preexisting lithospheric weaknesses marked by ancient tectonic patterns that focus the extensional strain. The hypothesis favored here is {SE}-ward relative divergent drifting of a not yet well individualized Somalian plate, a model in agreement with the existence of {NW}-striking transform and transfer zones. The East African rift system comprises a unique succession of graben basins linked and segmented by intracontinental transform, transfer and accommodation zones. In an attempt to make a point on the rift system evolution through time and space, it is clear that the role of plume impacts is determinant. The main phenomenon is formation of domes related to plume effect, weakening the lithosphere and, long after, failure inducing focused upper mantle thinning, asthenospheric intrusion and related thermal uplift of shoulders. The plume that had formed first at around 30Ma was not in the Afar but likely in Lake Tana region (Ethiopia), its almost 1000km diameter panache weakening the lithosphere and preparing the later first rifting episode along a preexisting weak zone, a Pan-African suture zone bordering the future Afar region. From the Afar, the rift propagated afterward from north to south on the whole, with steps of local lithospheric failure nucleations along preexisting weak zones. These predisposed lines are mainly suture zones, in which partial activation of low angle detachment faults reworked former thrust faults verging in opposite directions, belonging to double verging ancient belts. This is responsible for eventual reversal in rift asymmetry from one basin to the next. Supposing the plume migrated southward, or other plumes emplaced, the rift could propagate following former weaknesses, even outside areas influenced by plumes. This view of rift formation reconciles the classical models: active plume effect triggered the first ruptures; passive propagations of failure along lithospheric scale weak zones were responsible for the onset of the main rift segments. Various other aspects are shortly considered, such as tectonics and sedimentation, and relationships of the ‘cradle of Mankind’ with human evolution. By its size, structure and occurrence of oceanic lithosphere in the Afar, the {EARS} can be taken as a model of the prelude of oceanic opening inside a continent.},

	abstract = {Stress measurements in deep boreholes have universally shown that stresses in the Earth's crust are in equilibrium with favorably oriented faults with friction coefficients in the range 0.6–0.7 and with nearly hydrostatic pore-pressure gradients. Because of the lack of any fault-adjacent heat-flow anomaly as predicted by a conductive model of frictional heating, the San Andreas fault has long been thought to be an exception, i.e., far weaker than this standard case. Borehole stress measurements near the San Andreas fault have failed to confirm this weak-fault hypothesis, being either inconclusive or in conflict with it. Directions of maximum horizontal stresses reported to be nearly fault normal in central California are now known not to be regional stresses but a result of active folding within folds that have been rotated 20°–30° clockwise from their original orientations. Everywhere in southern California it is observed that the maximum stress directions rotate to smaller angles (30°–60°) with the San Andreas, within 20 km of it. The sense of this rotation is opposite to that expected from the weak-fault hypothesis and indicates that the shear stress on the San Andreas is comparable in magnitude to all other horizontal stresses in the system. In the “big bend” section of the fault, this rotation is predicted from a transpressional plate-boundary model in which the San Andreas is loaded by a deep shear zone with a locking depth of 10 km. If the adjacent minor thrust faults are assumed to obey Byerlee friction, the crustal-average shear stress on the San Andreas in that region must be in the range 100–160 {MPa}, regardless of the pore pressure in the fault. These stresses are many times greater than permitted by the weak-fault hypothesis. In the more transcurrent regions farther south, the San Andreas shear stress will be smaller than this estimate, but similar stress rotations observed there indicate that the San Andreas cannot be weak relative to minor faults in that region. These stress rotations can only be consistent with the weak-fault hypothesis if it were assumed that all faults in California were equally weak, which is known to be untrue. The conclusion is that the heat-flow model is flawed, probably in its assumption that all heat transfer is governed by conduction.},

The acoustic records allow to characterize the Mach wavefront radiated from the supershear rupture front, in particular its amplitude and decay. Velocity functions recovered by integrating high frequency accelerometer signals in the case of supershear ruptures, consist in a double-pulse function: a first pulse traveling at supershear velocity followed by a second pulse traveling at the Rayleigh wave velocity. Conversely, the sub-shear event is characterized by a single pulse. Finally, we perform numerical simulations of our experiment using a prescribed supershear rupture velocity. The synthetic waveforms obtained from these simulations, including the Mach wave amplitude and phase, yield a satisfactory fit to the experimental results.},

In the present study, we provide the first experimental evidence of intersonic crack growth in such constitutively homogeneous and isotropic solids, ever recorded in a laboratory setting. Intersonic shear dominated crack growth, featuring shear shock waves, was observed along weak planes in a brittle polyester resin under far-field asymmetric loading. The shear cracks initially propagate at speeds just above csand subsequently accelerate rapidly to the longitudinal wave speed (cl) of the solid. At longer times, when steady state conditions are attained, they propagate at speeds slightly higher than √2–cs. The experimental results compare well with existing asymptotic theories of intersonic crack growth, and the significance of the preferred speed of √2–csis discussed.},

	shorttitle = {Stress Wave Source Characterization},
	abstract = {Rapidly varying forces, such as those associated with impact, rapid crack propagation, and fault rupture, are sources of stress waves which propagate through a solid body. This dissertation investigates how properties of a stress wave source can be identified or constrained using measurements recorded at an array of sensor sites located far from the source. This methodology is often called the method of acoustic emission and is useful for structural health monitoring and the noninvasive study of material behavior such as friction and fracture. In this dissertation, laboratory measurements of 1-300 mm wavelength stress waves are obtained by means of piezoelectric sensors which detect high frequency (10 {kHz}- 3MHz) motions of a specimen's surface, picometers to nanometers in amplitude. Then, stress wave source characterization techniques are used to study ball impact, drying shrinkage cracking in concrete, and the micromechanics of stick-slip friction of Poly(methyl methacrylate) ({PMMA}) and rock/rock interfaces. In order to quantitatively relate recorded signals obtained with an array of sensors to a particular stress wave source, wave propagation effects and sensor distortions must be accounted for. This is achieved by modeling the physics of wave propagation and transduction as linear transfer functions. Wave propagation effects are precisely modeled by an elastodynamic Green's function, sensor distortion is characterized by an instrument response function, and the stress wave source is represented with a force moment tensor. These transfer function models are verified though calibration experiments which employ two different mechanical calibration sources: ball impact and glass capillary fracture. The suitability of the ball impact source model, based on Hertzian contact theory, is experimentally validated for small ({\textasciitilde}1 mm) balls impacting massive plates composed of four different materials: aluminum, steel, glass, and {PMMA}. Using this transfer function approach and the two mechanical calibration sources, four types of piezoelectric sensors were calibrated: three commercially available sensors and the Glaser-type conical piezoelectric sensor, which was developed in the Glaser laboratory. The distorting effects of each sensor are modeled using autoregressive-moving average ({ARMA}) models, and because vital phase information is robustly incorporated into these models, they are useful for simulating or removing sensor-induced distortions, so that a displacement time history can be retrieved from recorded signals. The Glaser-type sensor was found to be very well modeled as a unidirectional displacement sensor which detects stress wave disturbances down to about 1 picometer in amplitude. Finally, the merits of a fully calibrated experimental system are demonstrated in a study of stress wave sources arising from sliding friction, and the relationship between those sources and earthquakes. A laboratory friction apparatus was built for this work which allows the micro-mechanisms of friction to be studied with stress wave analysis. Using an array of 14 Glaser-type sensors, and precise models of wave propagation effects and the sensor distortions, the physical origins of the stress wave sources are explored. Force-time functions and focal mechanisms are determined for discrete events found amid the "noise" of friction. These localized events are interpreted to be the rupture of micrometer-sized contacts, known as asperities. By comparing stress wave sources from stick-slip experiments on plastic/plastic and rock/rock interfaces, systematic differences were found. The rock interface produces very rapid (\&lt;1 microsecond) implosive forces indicative of brittle asperity failure and fault gouge formation, while rupture on the plastic interface releases only shear force and produces a source more similar to earthquakes commonly recorded in the field. The difference between the mechanisms is attributed to the vast differences in the hardness and melting temperatures of the two materials, which affect the distribution of asperities as well as their failure behavior. With proper scaling, the strong link between material properties and laboratory earthquakes will aid in our understanding of fault mechanics and the generation of earthquakes and seismic tremor.},

Recent experimental results showed a close relation between this speed and the local ratio of shear to normal stress measured before slip occurs (static stress ratio). Using a two-dimensional finite element model, we demonstrate, however, that fronts propagating in different directions do not have the same dynamics under similar stress conditions. A lack of correlation is also observed between accelerating and decelerating slip fronts. These effects cannot be entirely associated with static local stresses but call for a dynamic description. Considering a dynamic stress ratio (measured in front of the slip tip) instead of a static one reduces the above-mentioned inconsistencies. However, the effects of the direction and acceleration are still present. To overcome this, we propose an energetic criterion that uniquely associates, independently on the direction of propagation and its acceleration, the slip front velocity with the relative rise of the energy density at the slip tip.},

	abstract = {Even though friction affects everyday life in many ways, it is still one of the biggest mysteries of physics. Friction is a truly multi-scale phenomenon with a large variety of processes acting at various length and time scales. In recent years, much attention was paid to the micro- and nano-scale properties of frictional interfaces in order to uncover the origins of friction. The structural aspects of friction at the meso- to macro-scales have, however, often been neglected. This thesis aims at demonstrating that these aspects are key to the frictional response of macroscopic systems and pursues therefore the objective of improving today's knowledge of the rupture-like propagation of slip fronts at frictional interfaces. The mechanics of frictional interfaces is studied with state-of-the-art dynamic finite-element simulations of systems mimicking experimental set-ups. Two and three-dimensional simulations are conducted according to the nature of the studied phenomena. In addition, theoretical models based on fracture mechanics theory are developed and applied to confirm the numerical observations. These models provide insights on the underlying mechanisms of the slip front propagation and reveal the influence of various system, material, and interface parameters. The results presented in this thesis show that the applied numerical models reproduce quantitatively well experimental observations as reported in literature. The studied aspects of frictional slip include, among others, the propagation speed, the arrest position, and the effect of interface heterogeneity. Beyond confirming experimental observations, the simulations and theoretical models further reveal new features of the propagation and arrest of slip fronts. They show, for instance, that the speed of slip fronts depends on the propagation direction and that the arrest position of slip precursors is predictable with linear elastic fracture mechanics theory. Furthermore, simulations of slip fronts at heterogeneous interfaces uncover an interaction between the length scales of the slip front and the heterogeneous pattern},

	abstract = {We investigate numerically the dynamic in-plane propagation of a centered crack along bimaterial interfaces using a spectral formulation of the elastodynamic boundary integral equations. Particular attention is given to the effect of contact zones at the subsonic/intersonic transition. In a single set-up, we simulate and describe the different phenomenon observed experimentally (distinct natures of contact zones, unfavorable velocity range, asymmetric crack propagation). We show that different behaviors are observed as function of the crack propagation direction, i.e., with respect to the particle displacements of the compliant material. When the crack propagates in the same direction, the propagation velocities between \$\$c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}\$\$and \$\$c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}\$\$are forbidden and the subsonic/intersonic transition occurs with the nucleation of a daughter crack in front of the main rupture. The intersonic stress field at the crack front is compressive due to the material mismatch and a contact zone appears behind the tip. In the opposite direction, a smooth subsonic/intersonic transition occurs although crack face closure (in normal direction) is observed for speeds between \$\$c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}\$\$and \$\${\textbackslash}sqrt\{2\}c\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}\$\$. In this regime, a Rayleigh disturbance is generated at the crack surface causing a contact zone which detaches from the tip. Using a contact model governed by a regularized Coulomb law, we provide a quantitative evaluation of the influence of friction on the effective fracture toughness. Finally, we show the applicability of our analysis to the description of different bimaterial situations as well as the single-material set-up.},

	abstract = {The rupture of dry frictional interfaces occurs through the propagation of fronts breaking the contacts at the interface. Recent experiments have shown that the velocities of these rupture fronts range from quasistatic velocities proportional to the external loading rate to velocities larger than the shear wave speed. The way system parameters influence front speed is still poorly understood. Here we study steady-state rupture propagation in a one-dimensional (1D) spring-block model of an extended frictional interface for various friction laws. With the classical Amontons-Coulomb friction law, we derive a closed-form expression for the steady-state rupture velocity as a function of the interfacial shear stress just prior to rupture. We then consider an additional shear stiffness of the interface and show that the softer the interface, the slower the rupture fronts. We provide an approximate closed form expression for this effect. We finally show that adding a bulk viscosity on the relative motion of blocks accelerates steady-state rupture fronts and we give an approximate expression for this effect. We demonstrate that the 1D results are qualitatively valid in 2D. Our results provide insights into the qualitative role of various key parameters of a frictional interface on its rupture dynamics. They will be useful to better understand the many systems in which spring-block models have proved adequate, from friction to granular matter and earthquake dynamics.},

	abstract = {The failure of the population of microjunctions forming the frictional interface between two solids is central to fields ranging from biomechanics to seismology. This failure is mediated by the propagation along the interface of various types of rupture fronts, covering a wide range of velocities. Among them are the so-called slow fronts, which are recently discovered fronts much slower than the materials’ sound speeds. Despite intense modeling activity, the mechanisms underlying slow fronts remain elusive. Here, we introduce a multiscale model capable of reproducing both the transition from fast to slow fronts in a single rupture event and the short-time slip dynamics observed in recent experiments. We identify slow slip immediately following the arrest of a fast front as a phenomenon sufficient for the front to propagate further at a much slower pace. Whether slow fronts are actually observed is controlled both by the interfacial stresses and by the width of the local distribution of forces among microjunctions. Our results show that slow fronts are qualitatively different from faster fronts. Because the transition from fast to slow fronts is potentially as generic as slow slip, we anticipate that it might occur in the wide range of systems in which slow slip has been reported, including seismic faults.},

The technique captures the evolution of displacements, velocities and stresses of dynamic ruptures, whose rupture speed range from sub-Rayleigh to supershear. The observed friction has complex evolution, featuring initial velocity strengthening followed by substantial velocity weakening. Our measurements are consistent with rate-and-state friction formulations supplemented with flash heating but not with widely used slip-weakening friction laws. This study develops a new approach for measuring local evolution of dynamic friction and has important implications for understanding earthquake hazard since laws governing frictional resistance of faults are vital ingredients in physically-based predictive models of the earthquake source.},

              This paper reviews laboratory observations of earthquake initiation and describes new experiments on a 3‐m rock sample where the nucleation process is imaged in detail. Many of the laboratory observations are consistent with previous work that showed a slow and smoothly accelerating earthquake nucleation process that expands to a critical nucleation length scale
              L
              c
              , before it rapidly accelerates to dynamic fault rupture. The experiments also highlight complexities not currently considered by most theoretical and numerical models. This includes a loading rate dependency where a “kick” above steady state produces smaller and more abrupt initiation. Heterogeneity of fault strength also causes abrupt initiation when creep fronts coalesce on a stuck patch that is somewhat stronger than the surrounding fault. Taken together, these two mechanisms suggest a rate‐dependent “cascade up” model for earthquake initiation. This model simultaneously accounts for foreshocks that are a by‐product of a larger nucleation process and similarities between initial
              P
              wave signatures of small and large earthquakes. A diversity of nucleation conditions are expected in the Earth's crust, ranging from slip limited environments with
              L
              c
              {\textless} 1 m, to ignition‐limited environments with
              L
              c
              {\textgreater} 10 km. In the latter case,
              L
              c
              fails to fully characterize the initiation process since earthquakes nucleate not because a slipping patch reaches a critical length but because fault slip rate exceeds a critical power density needed to ignite dynamic rupture.

            Plain Language Summary
            
              In uniquely large‐scale laboratory experiments, a 3‐m rock sample is squeezed until earthquake‐like slip events spontaneously develop on a planar fault cut through the sample. This paper describes the initiation of those slip events—where one part of the fault begins to slip a fraction of a second before the rest of it ruptures (i.e., preslip). The laboratory observations are compared to theoretical models, computer simulations, and field studies of foreshock sequences and other earthquake precursors. Many observations are consistent with previous work that showed slow and smoothly accelerating earthquake initiation—a process termed earthquake nucleation. When the preslip region grows larger than a critical length scale
              L
              c
              ({\textasciitilde}1 m), it accelerates unstably and radiates seismic waves like an earthquake. However, some observations show an order of magnitude variation in apparent
              L
              c
              . The initiation process is sensitive to details such as naturally occurring variation in the strength of the rock/rock fault and perturbations in the rate at which the rock is loaded. Put together, the laboratory work suggests that smoothly accelerating earthquake nucleation is a property of unnaturally smooth and homogenous faults and that
              L
              c
              is an incomplete metric for characterizing the initiation of earthquakes on realistically rough natural faults.

              We report on laboratory experiments which investigate interactions between aseismic slip, stress changes, and seismicity on a critically stressed fault during the nucleation of stick‐slip instability. We monitor quasi‐static and dynamic changes in local shear stress and fault slip with arrays of gages deployed along a simulated strike‐slip fault (2 m long and 0.4 m deep) in a saw cut sample of Sierra White granite. With 14 piezoelectric sensors, we simultaneously monitor seismic signals produced during the nucleation phase and subsequent dynamic rupture. We observe localized aseismic fault slip in an approximately meter‐sized zone in the center of the fault, while the ends of the fault remain locked. Clusters of high‐frequency foreshocks (
              
                M

               {\textasciitilde} −6.5 to −5.0) can occur in this slowly slipping zone 5–50 ms prior to the initiation of dynamic rupture; their occurrence appears to be dependent on the rate at which local shear stress is applied to the fault. The meter‐sized nucleation zone is generally consistent with theoretical estimates, but source radii of the foreshocks (2 to 70 mm) are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the theoretical minimum length scale over which earthquake nucleation can occur. We propose that frictional stability and the transition between seismic and aseismic slip are modulated by local stressing rate and that fault sections, which would typically slip aseismically, may radiate seismic waves if they are rapidly stressed. Fault behavior of this type may provide physical insight into the mechanics of foreshocks, tremor, repeating earthquake sequences, and a minimum earthquake source dimension.

            In this study we explore experimentally the effects of fault heterogeneity on the rupture nucleation. We conducted friction experiments between two polycarbonate plates, with a periodically heterogeneous friction interface. The rupture propagation is monitored with an ultra‐fast video camera by taking advantage of the photo‐elastic properties of the material used. We show that the nucleation process does not always consists of a monotonic growth of the rupture velocity. Instead, the rupture front advances with an alternation of slow and fast episodes that accelerates until it reaches a point at which fast propagation dominates. This complex nucleation process is compared to the results predicted by previous numerical studies on heterogeneous interfaces. Finally, we test whether it is possible to describe this complex nucleation process as a homogenized nucleation. We also point out a large variability in the rupture process due to the uncontrolled stress heterogeneity that occurs during the loading process.

            Plain Language Summary
            Measurements of earth surface deformation and of small intensity seismicity suggest that some large earthquakes are preceded by slow preparatory processes. Independently, several laboratory experiments, by sliding two blocks of rocks or plastic against one‐another, have shown that the slip begins with a so‐called initiation phase, during which the slipping area slowly grows until it reaches a size at which it accelerates and produces seismic waves. Whether this kind of initiation process is relevant for earthquakes is debated because these processes have been observed on homogeneous interfaces, very different from natural heterogeneous faults. To address this discrepancy, we mimicked earthquakes in the laboratory by sliding two blocks of plastic against one‐another, and observed the slip initiation with an ultra‐fast camera. We created an alternation of rough and smooth areas at the interface by roughening them with two different kinds of sandpaper. We observed a complex initiation process that consists of an accelerating alternation of slow and rapid episodes that enlarge the slipping area until the final large and fast rupture is triggered. These observations suggest that, on real faults, slow slip and seismic precursors could both be related as parts of a global complex initiation process.

          , 
            The rupture fronts that mediate the onset of frictional sliding may propagate at speeds below the Rayleigh wave speed or may surpass the shear wave speed and approach the longitudinal wave speed. While the conditions for the transition from sub-Rayleigh to supershear propagation have been studied extensively, little is known about what dictates supershear rupture speeds and how the interplay between the stresses that drive propagation and interface properties that resist motion affects them. By combining laboratory experiments and numerical simulations that reflect natural earthquakes, we find that supershear rupture propagation speeds can be predicted and described by a fracture mechanics–based equation of motion. This equation of motion quantitatively predicts rupture speeds, with the velocity selection dictated by the interface properties and stress. Our results reveal a critical rupture length, analogous to Griffith’s length for sub-Rayleigh cracks, below which supershear propagation is impossible. Above this critical length, supershear ruptures can exist, once excited, even for extremely low preexisting stress levels. These results significantly improve our fundamental understanding of what governs the speed of supershear earthquakes, with direct and important implications for interpreting their unique supershear seismic radiation patterns.},

In this review paper, we summarize the past work using the technique, describe the optics underlying the technique, and illustrate how it can be used to quantitatively determine the vector contact forces between particles in a 2D granular system.
